OpenSWG THANKS

The vision of a PreNGE Star Wars Galaxies emulator came before the time 
of the OpenSWG project. The SWGEmu team inspired the developers of OpenSWG
and with the help of their open source release we are now able to use
their work and carry on the open source initiative. Be sure to check
http://www.swgemu.com often, these guys work hard and deserve a big thanks.

We would also like to thank the MaNGOS project, an open source WoW 
emulator; being able to look at how a fully functional emulator works has
provided many ideas. They also had a number of network utilities that we 
will be using to make life a little easier on the devs.

Following is a list of people who have contributed to this project in 
some form or another, either by collecting information or by submitting
source code.
